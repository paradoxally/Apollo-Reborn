# Distribution Guide

This repo can publish the same four Apollo distribution variants that Balackburn’s repo exposed, but with the Liquid Glass icon catalog handled in-house.

## Variants

- `Apollo-Reborn-<tweak>.ipa`: standard injected IPA
- `Apollo-Reborn-<tweak>-NOEXTENSIONS.ipa`: standard IPA with app extensions removed
- `Apollo-Reborn-<tweak>-GLASS.ipa`: standard injected IPA plus `patch.sh --liquid-glass`
- `Apollo-Reborn-<tweak>-GLASS-NOEXTENSIONS.ipa`: no-extensions IPA plus `patch.sh --liquid-glass`

The GitHub release tag still includes the supported Apollo base version
(`v<apollo>_<tweak>`, for example `v1.15.11_3.0.0`), but the IPA asset names
are Apollo-Reborn first because the distributed app version is now the
Apollo-Reborn version.

## What “No Extensions” Means

Apollo ships with six `.appex` bundles in addition to the main app:

- `ApolloIntentions.appex`
- `Apollofari.appex`
- `AthenaWidgetExtension.appex`
- `NotificationContentExtension.appex`
- `NotificationServiceExtension.appex`
- `OpenInUIExtension.appex`

Keeping them intact uses 7 App IDs total on free Apple IDs: 1 for the main app plus 6 for the extensions above. Removing them leaves only the main app, so AltStore Classic/SideStore only need 1 App ID for Apollo itself. AltStore documents the underlying limit here: <https://faq.altstore.io/altstore-classic/app-ids>.

A free Apple ID can register at most **10 App IDs per rolling 7 days**, so the with-extensions build installs on a clean run but leaves only ~3 App IDs of headroom. Reinstalling within the same week, installing under more than one bundle ID, or sideloading other extension-bearing apps can push past 10, at which point the install fails until older App IDs expire (a paid Apple Developer account has a far higher cap). The No Extensions build (1 App ID) is the headroom-friendly fallback. App-group / keychain-access-group entitlements are **not** a factor here: the main app carries them in both builds and the signer rewrites them on re-sign, so a free Apple ID can install either build — the only difference is the App ID count.

> **Note on the v3.2.0 size drop.** Since v3.2.0 the standard build replaces the stock 28 MB `AthenaWidgetExtension.appex` (a 25.6 MB `Assets.car`) with the much smaller `ApolloRebornWidgets.appex` (the stock widget crash-looped and poisoned WidgetKit enumeration). That is why the with-extensions IPA is ~25 MB smaller than v3.1.1's — all the functional extensions are still present (the with-extensions IPA is still larger than No Extensions); only the bloated stock widget was swapped out. A smaller with-extensions IPA is **not** a sign that extensions were dropped.

## Local Build Flow

1. Build the tweak:

```bash
make package
```

2. Build all four IPA variants from a decrypted Apollo IPA or prepared base IPA:

```bash
./scripts/build_release_variants.sh --ipa ./Apollo.ipa
```

By default this writes the four output files to `dist/out/`.

Implementation details:

- Standard build goes through [`build-ipa.sh`](build-ipa.sh), so it can use the repo-local deterministic injector when the input IPA is already scaffolded.
- No-extensions builds use `cyan -e`.
- Glass variants are derived by running [`patch.sh --liquid-glass`](patch.sh) on the two injected outputs.
- Unlike Balackburn’s older flow, `patch.sh` also installs the bundled Liquid Glass `Assets.car` and alternate icon metadata from `liquid-glass/icons.json`.

## GitHub Actions Release Flow

Use the workflow:

- [.github/workflows/release-ipa-variants.yml](.github/workflows/release-ipa-variants.yml)

Inputs:

- `apollo_ipa_url`: required; must point to a decrypted Apollo IPA or a prepared base IPA
- `prerelease`: optional GitHub prerelease flag
- `draft`: optional GitHub draft flag
- `update_sources`: regenerate the AltStore-style source JSON files and push them back to `main`

The workflow:

1. Builds the rootful tweak `.deb`
2. Downloads the input Apollo IPA
3. Validates release metadata before the expensive IPA variant build:
   - `control` has the Apollo-Reborn tweak version
   - `distribution/config.json` has a numeric monotonic `app.buildVersion`
   - `CHANGELOG.md` has a matching `## [v<tweak>]` entry
   - the computed release tag does not already exist
4. Builds the four IPA variants
5. Creates a GitHub release tagged `v<apollo>_<tweak>`
6. Optionally regenerates and validates:
   - [apps.json](apps.json)
   - [apps_noext.json](apps_noext.json)
   - [apps_glass.json](apps_glass.json)
   - [apps_noext_glass.json](apps_noext_glass.json)
   - [release-manifest.json](release-manifest.json)

### When the source JSON / website updates

The source JSON files and `release-manifest.json` (what the website reads) only
ever point at **published** release assets — draft assets aren't publicly
downloadable. There are two ways they get regenerated and pushed to `main`:

- **Automated ship**: dispatch with `draft: false`. The build job creates the
  release and regenerates + commits the sources inline in the same run.
- **Review then publish**: dispatch with `draft: true` (the default). You get a
  draft release to review/test. The sources are **not** touched yet. When you
  press **Publish** on the release in the GitHub UI,
  [.github/workflows/publish-sources.yml](.github/workflows/publish-sources.yml)
  fires on the `release: released` event and regenerates + pushes the sources.

These two paths never double-run: a release created by the build workflow's own
`GITHUB_TOKEN` does not fire the `release` event, so only the inline path runs
for `draft: false`. `publish-sources.yml` can also be dispatched manually to
rebuild the sources on demand.

## AltStore Classic Source Setup

AltStore Classic sources are plain JSON files. Official schema: <https://faq.altstore.io/developers/make-a-source>.

Apollo-Reborn is supported in AltStore Classic, SideStore, and Feather. It is not compatible with AltStore PAL.

This repo now includes four source files:

- `apps.json`
- `apps_noext.json`
- `apps_glass.json`
- `apps_noext_glass.json`

They are generated by:

```bash
python3 ./scripts/update_source_json.py
```

That script reads:

- [distribution/config.json](distribution/config.json)
- the repo’s GitHub releases

and updates the four JSON sources so each source only advertises the matching asset prefix.

### Source metadata and versioning

Per-app metadata (icon, screenshots, description, `appPermissions`) lives in
[distribution/config.json](distribution/config.json) under `app`, and per-variant
overrides under each entry in `variants`. Notes on the model:

- **Versioning**: the release pipeline rewrites the main app's
  `CFBundleShortVersionString` to the Apollo-Reborn tweak version and
  `CFBundleVersion` to the monotonic build number in
  [distribution/config.json](distribution/config.json) (currently `286`). The
  source generator mirrors those exact values in `version` and `buildVersion`
  because AltStore validates them against the downloaded IPA before installing.
  Historical IPAs used Apollo's original `1.15.11`/`285` values, so generated
  sources advertise only the newest installable build while keeping older
  release notes in `news`.
- **Build number policy**: `app.buildVersion` must increase for every shipped
  public release, regardless of how the semantic tweak version changes. For
  example: `3.0.0 -> 286`, `3.0.1 -> 287`, `3.1.0 -> 288`. Do not reuse a
  build number, because AltStore/iOS use it to decide upgrade ordering.
- **`appPermissions`**: AltStore validates a source's declared entitlements and
  privacy strings against the downloaded IPA and warns ("Install Anyway") or
  refuses to install on a mismatch, so these must list the complete set the IPA
  carries. The values are extracted from the Apollo base IPA
  (`codesign -d --entitlements` across the main app and every `PlugIns/*.appex`
  for entitlements, `Info.plist` for the `NS*UsageDescription` privacy strings).
  `application-identifier` and `com.apple.developer.team-identifier` are
  intentionally omitted per AltStore's guidance. The declared set is identical
  across all four variants -- the main app binary carries the full entitlement
  set, so stripping extensions or patching icons does not change it.
- All four variants share Apollo's bundle identifier, so they cannot be combined
  into one source (the schema forbids duplicate bundle identifiers per source);
  one source per variant is required.

Recommended hosting options:

1. Use raw GitHub content URLs directly
2. Or serve the same JSON files via GitHub Pages / your own domain

Example raw URLs once pushed:

```text
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Apollo-Reborn/Apollo-Reborn/main/apps.json
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Apollo-Reborn/Apollo-Reborn/main/apps_noext.json
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Apollo-Reborn/Apollo-Reborn/main/apps_glass.json
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Apollo-Reborn/Apollo-Reborn/main/apps_noext_glass.json
```

Useful add-source link format for AltStore Classic:

```text
altstore-classic://source?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Apollo-Reborn/Apollo-Reborn/main/apps.json
```

Repeat with the other JSON URLs for the other variants.

AltStore PAL should not be used here. The JSON format is compatible, but Apollo-Reborn depends on the classic sideload flow.

## SideStore Setup

SideStore is compatible with AltStore Classic sources: <https://docs.sidestore.io/docs/advanced/app-sources>.

That means the same four JSON files work unchanged in SideStore.

Useful add-source link format:

```text
sidestore://source?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Apollo-Reborn/Apollo-Reborn/main/apps.json
```

Repeat with the other JSON URLs for the other variants.

## Feather Setup

Feather supports AltStore-style repositories and can open them from a custom URL scheme. The repository import URL format was documented in Feather’s v1.0.1 release notes:

- <https://newreleases.io/project/github/claration/Feather/release/v1.0.1>

Add-source link format:

```text
feather://source/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Apollo-Reborn/Apollo-Reborn/main/apps.json
```

Repeat with the other JSON URLs for the other variants.

## Recommended Publishing Model

For the least moving parts:

1. Keep IPA assets in GitHub Releases for this repo
2. Keep `apps*.json` in the repo root
3. Point users at the raw GitHub URLs or wrap them in add-source links for AltStore Classic/SideStore/Feather

That reproduces Balackburn’s distribution model, but with the Liquid Glass asset catalog and icon pipeline owned by this repo instead of living out-of-band.

## In-App Update Prompt

A sideloaded app can't install its own update (iOS only runs code signed by the user's certificate, which their sideloader holds), so the tweak (`src/ApolloUpdateChecker.m`) checks for a newer release and hands off:

- It fetches [release-manifest.json](release-manifest.json) from `main` at most once a day, plus Settings → About → Check for Updates. Versions compare on `release.tweakVersion`, so it must keep increasing per public release.
- The `ARBuildVariant` Info.plist stamp (`stamp-build-variant` in `build_release_variants.sh`) picks the manifest `variants` key: `ipa` → `standard`, `ipa-noext` → `noExtensions`, `glass` → `glass`, `glass-noext` → `noExtensionsGlass`, `glassicons` → `glassIcons`, `glassicons-noext` → `noExtensionsGlassIcons`. A sideloaded build with no stamp (an injected `.deb`, e.g. a `Build IPA` run) can't tell which variant it is, so its chooser just opens each sideloader app and swaps the IPA download for the release page; dev builds get only the release page, and `.deb` installs hide the feature. A new variant in `update_source_json.py` needs its mapping in `ApolloUpdateManifest.m`.
- A half-height sheet offers Update / Later / Skip this version. Release Notes expands it to show the changelog from the variant's source JSON (`apps[].versions[].localizedDescription`), prefetched when the sheet appears.
- Update opens a chooser (icons in `Resources/update-icon-*.png`): add-source links for AltStore Classic and SideStore, `feather://install/<ipa>` for Feather, `flarestore://downloadApp=<ipa>` for FlareStore, and a direct IPA download.

## Hosted Base IPA

This release pipeline expects a user-supplied public URL for an unmodified Apollo base IPA or another prepared Apollo base build. The workflow consumes that file as a plain download URL and does not require R2 credentials or GitHub secrets.
