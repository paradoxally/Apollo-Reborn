//     │ ▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬●━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ │  ← Apollo's own progress strip;
//     └────────────────────────────────────┘    hold it and slide to scrub
//
// Interaction model (v2 — reworked with the user after a tap-summoned overlay
// bar turned out to be the wrong shape; there is deliberately NO new chrome):
//
//   • The EXISTING bottom progress strip (RichMediaNode.videoGIFProgressView,
//     a 5pt UIVisualEffectView pinned across the video's bottom) IS the
//     scrubber. An invisible touch strip covers the bottom kStripHeight points
//     of the video picture and drives the player; Apollo's own progress
//     updates move the visible strip, so what you grab is what moves.
//   • Touch the strip and slide — no hold required: a UIGestureRecognizer
//     subclass observes the touch the instant it lands (the scroll view's
//     touch delay only holds back VIEW delivery, never recognizers) and the
//     playback position follows the finger's absolute position on the bar
//     (finger at 1/3 of the width ≈ 1/3 of the video).
//   • Direction classifies the touch, deterministically: horizontal
//     dominance scrubs (any speed), vertical dominance fails to the feed
//     scroll. The bar owns horizontal gestures outright; swipe back/forward
//     navigation owns the rest of the video.
//   • While the finger is on the bar the time-based hold blockers (the feed
//     context menu's driver, drag lifts) are quiet, and while a scrub is live
//     the interactive pop, Apollo's swipe-anywhere pans, and the list's
//     scrolling are all suspended, so a drag can't pop the screen or bob the
//     feed. All restored the moment the touch ends, with a dealloc backstop.
//   • A quick tap on the strip is forwarded to the stock open-fullscreen
//     route (didTapVideoNode:), so the bottom of a video never becomes a
//     dead zone for the tap everyone already knows.
//   • Player type doesn't matter — v.redd.it keeps its player on the
//     AVPlayerLayer, RedGifs / Streamable / sports clips / GIF-mp4s keep it
//     on the video node — because the player is resolved AT TOUCH TIME via
//     the unmute module's shared helper, which tries both in that order.
//     Badge-"GIF" posts whose animation is a Texture animated image have no
//     playing AVPlayer and no native progress strip; the strip refuses the
//     hit outright (pointInside), so their touches pass through untouched.
//
// The touch strip is installed lazily from the cell visibility events of
// LargePostCellNode (feed) and RichMediaHeaderCellNode/CommentsHeaderCellNode
// (the post's video in comments) — the same callbacks the feed-unmute feature
// rides in ApolloVideoUnmute.xm (separate %hooks in separate files; they
// chain). It lives as a subview of the RichMediaNode's view, so it dies with
// the cell, and it is retained by the node through an associated object.
