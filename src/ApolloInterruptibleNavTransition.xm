// ApolloInterruptibleNavTransition — run Apollo's push/pop animation through an interruptible
// UIViewPropertyAnimator on Liquid Glass, so UIKit drives the navigation bar the way it does
// for its own transitions.
//
// THE SYMPTOM
// On iOS 26, starting a swipe-back on a feed snaps the navigation bar to the previous screen
// the instant the edge pan is recognised: the title flips (Home -> Subreddits), the search
// palette collapses and the bar loses its height, all before the finger has moved more than a
// few points and while the feed is still fully on screen. Letting go (cancel) snaps it all
// back, with a one-frame layout jump under the bar. The right-hand pills never change, so the
// bar is visibly not cross-fading — it is being re-displayed.
//
// THE CAUSE (traced against decompiled UIKitCore 23B85 + a live sim trace)
// Apollo's ApolloNavigationAnimator is a plain UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning: it
// implements transitionDuration:/animateTransition: only, driving UIView block animations.
// For such a NON-interruptible animator, UINavigationController falls back to
// "tracked animations" for the bar: _UINavigationBarTransitionAssistant starts a
// UIViewPropertyAnimator tracking scope, runs the bar's item change inside it, and later
// scrubs the tracked animator with the gesture percent. That scope captures nothing from the
// iOS 26 bar (assistant animationCount stays 0; the item change lands as a plain layout), so
// the bar swaps immediately and the scrubbing has nothing to move.
//
// UIKit's own navigation transition is INTERRUPTIBLE (interruptibleAnimatorForTransition:),
// and on that path the bar's transition animations are added alongside the interruptible
// animator and scrubbed through its fractionComplete by the percent-driven interaction — the
// title cross-fades with the finger, the palette height animates, and a cancel reverses the
// whole thing smoothly. This module puts Apollo's transition on that path.
//
// WHAT IT DOES
// Registers interruptibleAnimatorForTransition: on Apollo's animator class, Liquid Glass only
// (the method is added by %init of a gated group, so pre-26 builds keep Apollo's class
// untouched). animateTransition: then just starts that animator. The animator reproduces
// Apollo's own geometry, recovered from the binary and confirmed with a live capture
// (sub_100683738 pop / sub_100682b04 push / sub_1006845bc shadow):
//   pop:  incoming view starts at x = -width/3 and slides to 0 under a black 15% dim that
//         fades out; outgoing view slides to x = width with a shadow view (black, alpha 0.25
//         light / 0.05 dark, offset (-5,0), radius 4, opacity 0.3) that fades out with it.
//   push: mirror image — incoming view slides in from x = width with the shadow, outgoing
//         view slides to x = -width/3 under the dim fading in.
//   0.225s linear when interactive, 0.5s spring (damping 1.0, initial velocity 4.0) otherwise.
// Apollo's search-mode special cases (hiding the bar while a search is presented) are not
// reproduced: on Liquid Glass the native search bar module keeps the bar in place anyway.
//
// ONE ANIMATOR PER TRANSITION, FOUND BY ITS CONTEXT
// ApolloNavigationController keeps a single ApolloNavigationAnimator and reuses it for every
// push and pop (it only flips isPresenting), so "the animator cached on that object" cannot
// tell transitions apart. UIKit asks interruptibleAnimatorForTransition: several times per
// transition (the bar's alongside animations, the percent-driven scrub, and our own
// animateTransition:) and every ask for one context must get the same UIViewPropertyAnimator,
// while a different context must always get a fresh one. Transitions also overlap on the
// stack: completeTransition: runs the navigation controller's completion synchronously, and a
// push or pop issued from there (didShowViewController: and friends) is built and started
// before the finishing transition's completion block even returns, with UIKit's own
// animationEnded: arriving last of all. So the cache is keyed on the context: the latest
// animator is kept on Apollo's animator object, each animator remembers (weakly) the context
// it was built for, and a lookup only hits when that context is the one asking. Nothing is
// ever cleared. A finished animator simply sits there until the next transition replaces it,
// and because the context reference is weak, a context that has been freed reads as nil, so a
// new context recycled at the same address can never be handed a finished animator.
//
// TWO THINGS THE INTERRUPTIBLE PATH CHANGES, HANDLED HERE
// - UIKit only disables user interaction on the transitioning views for NON-interruptible
//   animators. Left interactive, the finger that started the edge pan still delivers its
//   delayed touch to the post cell under it, which lit up the cell's highlight for two
//   frames at the start of every swipe. Both views are made non-interactive for the
//   transition and restored on completion, matching what UIKit did before.
// - The bar now genuinely cross-fades, so the incoming title control exists at partial alpha
//   for the whole drag. ApolloLiquidGlass installs its title capsule on any title control
//   that appears, which put a translucent capsule at the incoming title's (differently
//   centred) position — the "faded bubble in an odd spot" on a cancelled swipe. The capsule
//   code consults ApolloNavTransitionInFlight() and skips new installs/recentres while an
//   INTERACTIVE transition runs; the completion below asks it to refresh the settled bar,
//   where the winning title's capsule fades in. Timed push/pop is left exactly as before.
