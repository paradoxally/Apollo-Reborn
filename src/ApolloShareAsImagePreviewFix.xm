// ApolloShareAsImagePreviewFix.xm
//
// Two preview-only fixes for Apollo's "Share as Image" sheet
// (_TtC6Apollo26ShareAsImageViewController), found while finishing #484.
//
//   #1  SQUISHED COMMENT MEDIA. When you Share-as-Image a comment that contains an
//       inline GIF/image, the preview renders the media squished into a short card
//       until you toggle an option or drag the sheet. Apollo snapshots the preview
//       node into `previewSnapshotImageView` ONCE on present, and in
//       viewDidLayoutSubviews only RE-snapshots when the preview node's frame SIZE
//       differs from the current snapshot's size. A comment's media finishes
//       loading AFTER present and grows the node, but that internal Texture
//       re-measure never drives the view controller's viewDidLayoutSubviews — so the
//       initial (short, squished) snapshot sticks. Any settings toggle or drag
//       forces a relayout, which is why it "fixes itself." Fix: after present, drive
//       Apollo's own relayout (the same path a toggle takes) on a short polling loop
//       that OBSERVES the preview node's measured size rather than firing on a fixed
//       time ladder. It stops as soon as the node has grown (async media arrived) AND
//       the snapshot has caught up to the node's size — the exact size comparison
//       Apollo's re-snapshot gate uses — so a fast (cached) load settles in a pass or
//       two, while a slow/cold-cache load that finishes seconds later is still picked
//       up (the old fixed 3.5s ceiling could miss it). The native re-snapshot is
//       size-gated, so a relayout that finds nothing changed is a no-op.
//
//   #3  UPWARD-DRAG GLITCH. Press-dragging the preview sheet UPWARD lifts it off the
//       bottom of the screen: the pan handler moves the presented view's origin.y up
//       by up to ~40pt (rubber-banded) while keeping its height fixed, so the card's
//       bottom edge rises and exposes an empty gap beneath it that snaps back on
//       release — it reads as a glitch. Dragging up serves no purpose (the sheet
//       already shows all of its content; only a downward drag dismisses), so we
//       clamp the presented view during the drag so it can never rise above its
//       resting top. Downward (dismiss) drags are untouched.
//
//   #4  SHEET STAYS OPEN AFTER A SHARE COMPLETES. Tapping Share presents the iOS
//       activity sheet on top of the preview; after you actually save/message/mail
//       the image or video, the activity sheet dismisses but the preview sheet is
//       left sitting there. Both share paths (Apollo's native image share and our
//       own video share) present the activity sheet FROM the preview view controller,
//       so we hook its presentViewController: and wrap the activity sheet's
//       completion handler to also dismiss the preview — but only when the share
//       actually COMPLETED (cancelling the activity sheet leaves the preview up so
//       you can tweak options and try again).
//
//   #5  SHARE BUTTON OFF-SCREEN ON SHORT PHONES (#551). The view controller lays its
//       whole UI out with absolute frames directly on its (non-scrolling) view: title,
//       a preview snapshot, the option rows, then the Share button at the bottom — the
//       button's Y is `maxY(lastRow) + spacing` and the preview's height is whatever
//       the preview node measures with NO cap, and the view's own height is never
//       consulted (confirmed by RE: there's no UIScrollView and no clamp in this VC).
//       So when "Include Post Details" pulls a tall post (image/gallery) into the
//       preview, the button's Y grows past the bottom edge and is clipped — with no
//       scroll view to reach it. It only bites on short screens (e.g. iPhone SE 3,
//       667pt): taller phones have the room, which is why it slipped through. Fix:
//       after Apollo's native layout, if the Share button's bottom falls below the
//       visible area, shrink the on-screen preview (proportionally, preserving aspect)
//       by the overflow and slide the rows + button back up by the same amount, so the
//       button is always reachable. A no-op when everything already fits (so taller
//       devices are untouched). The EXPORTED image is unaffected: the share path reads
//       `previewSnapshotImageView.image` (the full-resolution snapshot), and we only
//       resize the image view's display frame, never its `image`.
//
// Pure ObjC-runtime access + public UIKit; no hardcoded binary addresses.
//
// MODULE ORDERING (Makefile ApolloReborn_FILES): this module is listed LAST of the
// four Share-as-Image modules (Gallery -> Link -> Video -> PreviewFix), so its hooks
// install last and wrap the others. In particular its presentViewController: hook is
// outermost, so it sees the activity sheet whether the native image share or
// ApolloShareAsVideo's own share presents it — which is exactly what the
// auto-dismiss (#4) needs. Keep it last if you reorder the Makefile.
